## Project Intro/Objective and Description
This is an e-commerce website data. The purpose of this project is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision. I used the Regression approach for hypothesis testing. The null hypothesis we are trying to reject is whether the conversion rate on the new page is less than or equal to the conversion rate on the old page.
