# E-Commerce A/B Test
This project is a part of the [Advanced Data Analysis Course](https://egfwd.com/specializtion/data-analysis-advanced/) at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).

#### -- Project Status: Completed

## Project Intro/Objective and Description
This is an e-commerce website data. The purpose of this project is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision. I used the Regression approach for hypothesis testing. The null hypothesis we are trying to reject is whether the conversion rate on the new page is less than or equal to the conversion rate on the old page.

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization

### Technologies
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas, Numpy, Statsmodels, Matplotlib

## Project Description
(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)

## Needs of this project

- data exploration/descriptive statistics
